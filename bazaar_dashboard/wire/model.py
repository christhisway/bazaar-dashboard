"""Our own vocabulary for every message in bazaar.proto.

This is the vocabulary the dashboard reads states and commands in.  Nothing
here imports the generated bindings: ``decode.py`` turns wire messages into
these types and is the only file that knows Protobuf exists.

Two conventions are worth stating because they differ from the schema:

* **Resource lists are plain Python lists.**  The proto wraps them in
  ``ListResource`` because proto2 cannot mark a ``repeated`` field ``required``
  and so cannot tell an empty list from a missing one.  Python already
  distinguishes ``[]`` from ``None``, so the wrapper buys nothing here and
  the wire re-adds it on the way out.
* **Nullable wrappers flatten to ``X | None``.**  The proto's two-armed
  ``NullableString`` becomes a plain optional field, and ``decode.py`` picks the arm.

``State.self`` in the schema collides with Python's ``self``, so it is named
``observation`` here.
