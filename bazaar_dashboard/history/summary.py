"""One run's ``messages.jsonl``, boiled down to what a history page can chart.

Pure, like ``view.py``: rows in, a plain dict out, no clock and no I/O.  It
reads the log as the JSON it was written as -- no ``model`` types, no
generated bindings -- so it works on any log in this shape, whether the
dashboard wrote it or a client did, and on logs written by older versions.
Every field is read defensively: an older log that lacks one gives a zero or a
``None``, never an exception.

The log has no timestamps, so everything here is measured in ticks.

A run ends one of three ways, and all three produce a summary:

* ``finished``    the server reached ``PHASE_FINISHED``;
* ``aborted``     the server ended the run early;
* ``interrupted`` the log simply stops -- Ctrl+C, a dropped connection, a crash.
  The summary covers what was seen, and ``progress`` says how far that got.

Where to look for things:

* What we *own* at the end (trades, offers, totals, health) comes from the last
  state.  A state carries the whole ledger, so it is complete even when the
  run was cut short.
* What we *did* (commands and how they ended) comes from sent messages matched
  to their results by ``request_id``.
* Per-tick curves come from the last state seen in each tick.

The ledger is the *run's*, not the session's: a client restarted mid-game sees
the trades and totals of the earlier session too, while its ``commands`` and
curves cover only what this log saw.  ``result.first_tick`` says where this
log's view begins.
