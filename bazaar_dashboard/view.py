"""What the dashboard shows, computed from one state as plain JSON.

Pure: no clock, no I/O, no memory of its own.  Everything that
needs remembering -- inventory over time, the actions we tried -- is handed in
by ``hub.Dashboard``, which is what lets a captured fixture render exactly as
it would live.

The one interpretive step is :func:`our_side`.  Offers and transactions record
amounts from the *proposer's* point of view, so "give 2 water" means we pay two
water only when we proposed it.  Every row the page shows goes through that one
function, so the direction of a deal is decided in exactly one place.

The agent sends commands faster than anyone can read them, so the page leads
with things that change slowly -- what is open, what the agent is after, counts
over the last few ticks -- and folds repeats into one line.  The raw action
list is still here, behind the page's "full action log".
